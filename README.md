## Course Overview

**Duration:** 10 weeks (Spring 2025)  
**Commitment:** 6-13 hours per week  
**Skill Level:** Introductory (TIP101)

### Objectives

- **Course Format & Goals:** Understand the course structure and objectives.
- **UPI Method:** Learn and apply the UPI (Understand, Plan, Implement) method for solving coding problems.
- **Python Basics:** Gain proficiency in Python, including variables, functions, print statements, and conditional logic.
- **Lists & Loops:** Develop skills in working with lists, including accessing and iterating.

## Tools

### Visual Studio Code (VS Code)

VS Code is our primary code editor for Python. Itâ€™s known for its flexibility, rich ecosystem of extensions, and support for multiple programming languages.
