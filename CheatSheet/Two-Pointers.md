two-pointer approach is a technique often used to solve 
problems involving sorted arrays or lists by using two pointers 
(or indices) to traverse or process the list in an efficient way.

The two-pointer method involves maintaining 
two pointers (or variables) to track positions in a list.
One pointer keeps track of the position to place the next 
unique element (unique_pos), while the other pointer (i) is 
used to traverse through the entire list.
